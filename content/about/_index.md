Hello, I am Zhaoran Hou, often go by Eric. I completed my PhD in statistics at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), under the supervision of [Samuel W.K. Wong](https://swong.ca/). I previously obtained my MMath in statistics in the same department, working with [Gregory Rice](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/profiles/greg-rice), and undergrad from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).

My interests are diverse, and I am happy to chat on new projects. Please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you!
